# Project Manager's Note

### Attention Team:

As we continue to enhance our project, I’d like to remind everyone of the following best practices when working on pull requests (PRs):

1. **Cross-Check for Overlapping Files/Components:** 
   - Ensure that your PR does not overlap with others. Review existing PRs to identify potential conflicts early on.

2. **Maintain a Checklist in PR Body:** 
   - Include a checklist in the body of your PR referencing any overlapping files or components with other PRs. This will help us keep track of dependencies and potential merge issues.

3. **Rebase Branches Before Final Merge:** 
   - Always rebase your branch against the main branch before final merging. This practice helps prevent conflicts and keeps our commit history clean.

Thank you for your cooperation! Let’s keep our project organized and conflict-free.
