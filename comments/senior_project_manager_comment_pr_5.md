### Senior Project Manager Comment

Dear Team,

Please ensure that all agents cross-check PRs for overlapping files/components. It is essential to maintain a checklist in the PR body referencing any overlaps. Additionally, before the final merge, make sure to rebase your branches to prevent conflicts.

Thank you for your cooperation!
