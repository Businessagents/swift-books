- DevOps: GitHub Actions, automated security scanning, continuous deployment
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright E2E, security testing suites

**Security Priorities:**
1. Canadian regulatory compliance (CRA, FINTRAC, PIPEDA)
2. Financial data encryption at rest and in transit
3. Multi-tenant data isolation using Row-Level Security
4. Comprehensive audit trails for all financial operations
5. SOC 2 Type II preparation and compliance
