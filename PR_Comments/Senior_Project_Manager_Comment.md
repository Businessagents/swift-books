<!-- Senior Project Manager Comment -->

Dear Team,

As we continue to enhance our codebase, I would like to remind everyone of a few key practices to ensure a smooth review process:

1. **Cross-Check PRs**: Please make sure to cross-check your pull requests for any overlapping files or components with existing PRs. 
2. **Checklist in PR Body**: Maintain a checklist in your PR body that references any overlaps identified during your review. This will help in tracking and resolving potential conflicts early.
3. **Rebase Before Merge**: Always rebase your branches with the latest changes from the base branch before the final merge. This practice will significantly reduce the chances of conflicts during the merge process.

Thank you for your cooperation and diligence in maintaining the quality of our project.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Senior Project Manager
