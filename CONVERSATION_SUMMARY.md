## Database Schema Updates

### New Fields Added:
```sql
-- Expenses table
status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' (pending/approved/rejected)
approved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)
approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
rejection_reason TEXT

-- Invoices table
viewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
reminder_sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
reminder_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
```

### New Database Objects:
- **Views**: `user_tax_summary`, `user_sales_summary` for reporting
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for status-based queries
- **RLS Policies**: Updated to include new fields while maintaining security

### Migration File:
`supabase/migrations/20250801000000_enhanced_features.sql`

## Business Rationale

### Enhanced Expense Management Purpose:
1. **Business Growth**: Solo freelancer ‚Üí team collaboration
2. **Client Billing Accuracy**: Approval before billable expenses
3. **Tax Compliance**: CRA audit trails and documentation
